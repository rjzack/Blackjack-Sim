The goal of this program is to create a successful blackjack simulator for entertainment, where the program serves as the dealer and user playing against the dealer. The program must be repeatable and outputs an image based on the result of the hand. The rules to blackjack will not be printed at the beginning, it is an assumption that the user previously knows how to play blackjack. The limitation of my program will not allow the user to split hands when dealt a pair and only one player is allowed to play at a time. These limitations will be expressed at the beginning of the program.
